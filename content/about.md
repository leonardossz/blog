I am a Software Engineer and former Entrepreneur with +20 years of experience. My main interests are Microservices, Java, Python, NodeJS, Cloud Computing, Distributed Applications, Descentralized Applications (dApps), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Semantic Web Technologies etc. 

This space is my personal collection of useful tricks and might have some good practices in Software Engineering that can be valuable for someone else. Don't take me too serious ;)
